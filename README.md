# Evaluation-of-Learning-Convex-Optimization-Control-Policies
Control policies are defined by parameters that govern the state inputs of a closed- loop control problem. Tuning these parameters is typically done through methods like grid search or other simpler optimization techniques. For convex-optimized control policies (COCP), the learnable policy algorithm leverages first-order differ- ential methods to estimate these parameters more efficiently. This paper explores this approach and implements it across various scenarios, including the novel case of the Mars soft landing problem, among others
